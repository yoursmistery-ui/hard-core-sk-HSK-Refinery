# Keyz' Allow Utilities
A utility mod that adds various quality-of-life improvements for managing items and plants across your colony map. This mod focuses on enhancing selection, allow/forbid controls, and plant management features.

## Features

### Selection Tools
A new gizmo (button) appears when selecting items that allows you to:
* Select all similar items visible on your current screen view
* Select all similar items across the entire map

### Allow/Forbid Controls
* Right-click Forbid Gizmo with options to:
  * Toggle allow/forbid status for similar items on screen
  * Toggle allow/forbid status for similar items across the entire map
* Convenient Hotkeys:
  * **Home key** - Allow all items across the map
  * **End key** - Forbid all items across the map

### Plant Management
Two new gizmos for efficient plant management:

**Harvest Fully Grown**
* Designate only fully mature plants for harvesting on screen
* Designate only fully mature plants for harvesting across the entire map

**Cut Fully Grown**
* Designate only fully mature plants for cutting on screen
* Designate only fully mature plants for cutting across the entire map

### Debug Tools
Available in the debug actions menu (requires debug mode):
* Grow plants to maturity in a selected area
* Replant an entire area
* Grow specific plant types in an area
* Clear all items in an area
* Clear all plants in an area

## Configuration
The mod includes settings to customize:
* Maximum number of items that can be selected at once

## Compatibility
This mod primarily adds new functionality without modifying core game systems, making it generally compatible with other mods.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
dotnet test 1.6/Source/KeyzAllowUtilities.Tests/KeyzAllowUtilities.Tests.csproj --framework net8.0
```

Tests target `net8.0` so they run natively on macOS and Linux without Mono. The production mod assembly still targets `net48` for RimWorld compatibility.
